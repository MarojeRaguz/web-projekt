# Restaurant Reservations 
This web app will have user's accounts for everyone who wants to make a reservation and for person who is in charge of managing reservations for specific restaurant. 
User, when registering, will receive an e-mail to confirm registration. Also, when reservation is confirmed or declined, user'll receive an e-mail.
There'll be a couple of restaurants that will use our services for reservation managment. Their menus will be available on website. 
Every restaurant will have to input number of available tables and admin will have to reserve table if someone reserved it by phone call. 
Green - available, Yellow - pending, Red - reserved in scheduler.
